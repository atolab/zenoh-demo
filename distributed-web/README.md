### Building a website from geo-dristributed content

$USE and $USW are two different host names, in our case scenario the two host are:

$USE = us-east.zenoh.io
$USW = us-west.zenoh.io

# Create a filesystem backend
```
curl -X PUT -H 'content-type:application/properties' \
  -d "" \
  $USW/@/router/local/plugin/storages/backend/fs
```
<!-- sleep 0.5 -->

# Create a filesystem storage on /public/**
```
curl -X PUT -H 'content-type:application/properties' \
  -d "path_expr=/public/**;path_prefix=/public;dir=public;read_only" \
  $USW/@/router/local/plugin/storages/backend/fs/storage/public
```

<!-- # On 1st working station: i.e. us-east.zenoh.io -->
# Filesystem backend
```
curl -X PUT -H 'content-type:application/properties' \
  -d "" \
  $USE/@/router/local/plugin/storages/backend/fs
```

sleep 0.5
# Filesystem storage on /public/**
curl -X PUT -H 'content-type:application/properties' \
  -d "path_expr=/public/**;path_prefix=/public;dir=public;read_only" \
  $USE/@/router/local/plugin/storages/backend/fs/storage/public
